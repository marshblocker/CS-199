# Geth Private Network Demo

## Important
The nodes are not created. You must run the scripts in `psscripts/`. Make sure to change some parts of the files (like the account public keys in the `extradata` field of `genesis.json`) in this repo if needed.

The configuration of the PS scripts assume that the nodes will be run in the same machine. You need to modify the scripts if you want to run the nodes in separate machines.
